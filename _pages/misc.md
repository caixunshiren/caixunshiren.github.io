- Caixunshiren (蔡浔是人) literally means Jack is a human. 
- My favorite animal is pig 🐷 (or perhaps cat 🐱?).
- My research ambition is to build machine intelligence that reaches human level. Checkout [*neuromorphic computing*][1] and [*Yann LaCun's JEPA*] [2] that inspires my work.
- Skateboarding is fun 🛹. It taught me to overcome fear and taking risks in order to gain rewards. I am not even close to being a good skater, but I like to take [*videos*][3] to see my progress.
