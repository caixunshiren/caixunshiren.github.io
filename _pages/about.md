Hey there!

My name is **Jack (Xun) Cai** (蔡浔). Xun is my Chinese name pronounced by /Sh'rin/. I go by either **Jack** or **Xun**.

I am an undergrad at the **University of Toronto** major in **Engineering Science** and **Machine Intelligence**. What is *[Engineering Science][1]* you may ask? It is the hardest engineering program in Canada and perhaps one of the hardest in the world. I enjoy learning and experimenting with tools I have, especially with **machine learning** in the domain of **electrical engineering** and **finance**. My current research is in ml accelerators and I have done a variety of projects, including inventing *[a new cryptography system][5]* and building a *[ml stock portfolio manager][6]*. In my free time, I like to [skateboard][4]. 

Feel free to check out my [*publications*][2], [*past projects*][3], and [*skate videos*][4].
