# PyTorch Metal-Oxide Memristor Crossbar
PyTorch implementation of the paper ["Comprehensive Compact Phenomenological Modeling of Integrated Metal-Oxide Memristors"][1]  using the crossbar line resistance model derived by [[2]][2].

This documentation page is still in construction as part of the summer research 2022. The code is done and the final product will be released as a python package for non-linear memristor crossbar device simulation.
