I have built a lot of things. Some of them are larger projects which I have showed you; but many more are smaller tools, scripts, and hackathon projects that are not very well documented. 

Here are a few that may be useful for you:

- [r/WallStreetBets comment scraper][1]: this script scrapes r/wallstreetbets daily discussion thread based on url patterns.

- [Alpaca News API handler][2]: this handles api calls for alpaca news api.

- [Finviz data scraper][3]: script that scrapes the finviz website for stock news.

- [r/oneliner scraper][4]: this script scrapes r/oneliners for NLP projects.

- [Wave physics simulation][5]: MATLAB script that simulates waves using Fourier transform.
