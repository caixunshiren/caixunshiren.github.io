I"«<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>My Name is <strong>Jack (Xun) Cai</strong>. Xun is my Chinese name pronounced by /Shrin/. I go by either Jack or Xun.</p>

<p>I am an undergrad at the <strong>University of Toronto</strong> major in <strong>Engineering Science</strong> and <strong>Machine Intelligence</strong>. What is Engineering Science you may ask? It is the hardest engineering program in Canada and perhaps one of the hardest in the world. I enjoy learning and experimenting with tools I have especially with <strong>machine learning</strong> in the domain of <strong>electrical engineering</strong> and <strong>finance</strong>. My current research is in ml accelerators and I have done a variety of projects, including inventing a new cryptography system and building a ml stock portfolio manager from scratch.</p>

<p>In my free time, I like to skateboard. Feel free to check out my publications, past projects, and things I do for fun.</p>
