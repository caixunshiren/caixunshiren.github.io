  <li>Caixunshiren (蔡浔是人) literally means Jack is a human. I have been using this name since 10 😆.</li>
  <li>My favorite animal is pig.</li>
  <li>Skateboarding is fun. It taught me to overcome fear and taking risks in order to gain rewards. I am not even close to being a good skater, but I like to take videos to see my progress.</li>
