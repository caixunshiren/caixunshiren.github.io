  <li>Caixunshiren (蔡浔是人) literally means Jack is a human.</li>
  <li>My favorite animal is pig 🐷 (or perhaps cat 🐱?).</li>
  <li>My research ambition is to build machine intelligence that reaches human level. Checkout <strong>neuromorphic computing</strong> and <em>*Yann LaCun’s JEPA</em></li>
  <li>Skateboarding is fun. It taught me to overcome fear and taking risks in order to gain rewards. I am not even close to being a good skater, but I like to take videos to see my progress.</li>
