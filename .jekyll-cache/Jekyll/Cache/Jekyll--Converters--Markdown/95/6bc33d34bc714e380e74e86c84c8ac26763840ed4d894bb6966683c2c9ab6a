I"=<!-- Hey there!

My Name is **Jack (Xun) Cai**. Xun is my Chinese name pronounced by /Sh'rin/. I go by either **Jack** or **Xun**.

I am an undergrad at the **University of Toronto** major in **Engineering Science** and **Machine Intelligence**. What is Engineering Science you may ask? It is the hardest engineering program in Canada and perhaps one of the hardest in the world. I enjoy learning and experimenting with tools I have especially with **machine learning** in the domain of **electrical engineering** and **finance**. My current research is in ml accelerators and I have done a variety of projects, including inventing *a new cryptography system* and building a *ml stock portfolio manager*. In my free time, I like to skateboard. 

Feel free to check out my *publications*, *past projects*, and *skate videos*. -->
