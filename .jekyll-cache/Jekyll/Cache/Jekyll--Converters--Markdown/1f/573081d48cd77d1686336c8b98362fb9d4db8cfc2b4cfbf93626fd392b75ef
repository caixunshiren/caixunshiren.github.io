  <li>Caixunshiren (蔡浔是人) literally means Jack is a human.</li>
  <li>My favorite animal is pig 🐷 (or perhaps cat 🐱?).</li>
  <li>My research ambition is to build machine intelligence that reaches human level. Checkout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering"><em>neuromorphic computing</em></a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf"><em>Yann LaCun’s JEPA</em></a> that inspire my work.</li>
  <li>I love to and I always keep my research open source. This is because I support the open source community and I believe that collaboration is what makes academia better.</li>
  <li>Skateboarding is fun 🛹. It taught me to overcome fear and taking risks in order to gain rewards. I am not even close to being a good skater, but I like to take <a href="/skatehof/"><em>videos</em></a> to see my progress.</li>
</ul>
