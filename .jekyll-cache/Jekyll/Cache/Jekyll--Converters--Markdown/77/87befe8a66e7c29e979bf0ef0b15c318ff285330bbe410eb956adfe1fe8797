I"ö<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>My Name is <strong>Jack (Xun) Cai</strong>. Xun is my Chinese name pronounced by /Shâ€™rin/. I go by either <strong>Jack</strong> or <strong>Xun</strong>.</p>

<p>I am an undergrad at the <strong>University of Toronto</strong> major in <strong>Engineering Science</strong> and <strong>Machine Intelligence</strong>. What is Engineering Science you may ask? It is the hardest engineering program in Canada and perhaps one of the hardest in the world. I enjoy learning and experimenting with tools I have especially with <strong>machine learning</strong> in the domain of <strong>electrical engineering</strong> and <strong>finance</strong>. My current research is in ml accelerators and I have done a variety of projects, including inventing <em>a new cryptography system</em> and building a <em>ml stock portfolio manager</em> from scratch.</p>

<p>In my free time, I like skateboard. Feel free to check out my <em>publications</em>, <em>past projects</em>, and my <em>skate videos</em>.</p>
