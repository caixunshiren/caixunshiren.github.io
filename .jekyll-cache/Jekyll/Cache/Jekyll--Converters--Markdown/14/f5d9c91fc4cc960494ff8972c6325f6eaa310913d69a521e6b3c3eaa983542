I"S<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>My Name is Jack (Xun) Cai. Xun is my Chinese name pronounced by /Shrin/. I go by either Jack or Xun.</p>

<p>I am an undergrad at the <strong>University of Toronto</strong> major in Engineering Science and specialize in Machine Intelligence. What is Engineering Science you may ask? It is the hardest engineering program in Canada and perhaps one of the hardest in the world. I enjoy learning and experimenting with tools I have especially with machine learning in the domain of electrical engineering and finance. My current research is in ml accelerators and I have done a variety of projects, including inventing a new cryptography system and building a ml stock portfolio manager from scratch.</p>

<p>In my free time, I like to skateboard. Feel free to check out my publications, past projects, and things I do for fun.</p>
