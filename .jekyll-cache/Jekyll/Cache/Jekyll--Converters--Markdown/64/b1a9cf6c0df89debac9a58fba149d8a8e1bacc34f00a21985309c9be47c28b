I"‚<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>My name is <strong>Jack (Xun) Cai</strong> (è”¡æµ”). Xun is my Chinese name pronounced by /Shâ€™rin/. I go by either <strong>Jack</strong> or <strong>Xun</strong>.</p>

<p>I am an undergrad at the <strong>University of Toronto</strong> major in <strong>Engineering Science</strong> and <strong>Machine Intelligence</strong>. What is <em><a href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/">Engineering Science</a></em> you may ask? It is the hardest engineering program in Canada and perhaps one of the hardest in the world. I enjoy learning and experimenting with tools I have especially with <strong>machine learning</strong> in the domain of <strong>electrical engineering</strong> and <strong>finance</strong>. My current research is in ml accelerators and I have done a variety of projects, including inventing <em>a new cryptography system</em> and building a <em>ml stock portfolio manager</em>. In my free time, I like to skateboard.</p>

<p>Feel free to check out my <a href="/publications/"><em>publications</em></a>, <a href="/projects/"><em>past projects</em></a>, and [<em>skate videos</em>][4].</p>

<p>[]</p>
