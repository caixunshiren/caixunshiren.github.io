  <li>My research ambition is to build machine intelligence that reaches human level. Checkout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering"><strong>neuromorphic computing</strong></a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf"><strong>Yann LaCunâ€™s JEPA</strong></a> that inspires my work.</li>
  <li>Skateboarding is fun ğŸ›¹. It taught me to overcome fear and taking risks in order to gain rewards. I am not even close to being a good skater, but I like to take <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf"><strong>videos</strong></a> to see my progress.</li>
