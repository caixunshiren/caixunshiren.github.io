I"…<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>My Name is Jack (Xun) Cai. Xun is my Chinese name pronouced by /Shrin/. When I first came to Canada at the age of 12 my teacher asked if I have a English name. â€œJackâ€ popped up in my mind and I have been using that name since then. I can go by either Jack or Xun.</p>

<p>I am a undergraduate student at the University of Toronto major in Engineering Science</p>
