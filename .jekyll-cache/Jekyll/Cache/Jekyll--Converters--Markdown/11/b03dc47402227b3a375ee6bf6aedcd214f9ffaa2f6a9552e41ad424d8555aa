I"G<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>My Name is Jack (Xun) Cai. Xun is my Chinese name pronouced by /Shrin/. When I first came to Canada at the age of 12 my teacher asked if I have a English name. “Jack” popped up in my mind and I have been using that name since then. I can go by either Jack or Xun.</p>

<p>I am a undergraduate student at the University of Toronto major in Engineering Science and specialize in Machine Intelligence. What is Engineering Science you may ask? It is the hardest engineering program in Canada and perhaps one of the hardest in the world. I enjoy learning and experimenting with tools I have especially with machine learning. My current research is in ml accelerators and I have done a variety of projects, including inventing a new cryptography system and building a deep learning stock portfolio manager platform</p>
